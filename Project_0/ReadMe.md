## This project name is Find a Trainer Online.
- Agenda is to create an application to add professional trainers details in a database and these trainers are able to upload their profiles, so that recruiters and clients can reach out to them to offer business as well get their team trained on required skill sets.
### As a first phase it will do the operations mentioned below. 
- Registering trainer details and login to the Main Page.
- At first, Trainer has to register if there is already existing details then they can go with the Login options
- After Successfull login trainer can have access for the operations related to his/her Details.
- There is five options that are :
    - Profile view
    - Educations details
    - Work experience details
    - Skills details
    - Additional details
- Trainer can work with these options, when they select any options they can get Add,Delete,Update and View for each Section.
- In profile view Trainer can get complete profile details and also have options for Updating Profile Data and Delete Complete Profile.
- With each section also Trainer can Add,Update,Delete and View the Details.

### Used Technologies
- Using azure data studio platform and T-SQL language for database operations.
- Using ADO.NET as connection technology to connect between console app to the database.
- Using C# Console App for designing simple User Interface.

### Project Flow
- At first need to check whether it is connected with the database or not and ensure about the connection string and its parameters.
- Then when it runs it will first show the options for Sign In and Sign Up.
- It will validate with the trainer Email ID and Password, If its success it will allow to work with the operations if its failed it will return to the Sign In and ask for retry.
- For Sign Up, Fill the values as per the system flow and it will be registered if its a new Email ID or else it will show Email is already Exist please Sign In.
